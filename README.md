# WFE-A-Hybrid-Feature-Selection-Method
The repo contains a novel Hybrid Feature Selection method that reduce redundant features to improve prediction accuracy of a Machine Learning Classifier. The method combines some traditional Feature Selection Algorithm to built a new technique which can overcome the existing drawback of traditional techniques. We named the method as WFE. There WFE represents Wrapper, Filter, and Ensemble respectively.
